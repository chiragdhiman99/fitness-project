        <h2>Start with whole grain cereal.</h2>
        <br>
       
        <p>Starting your day with whole grain cereal is a nutritious choice that can provide numerous health benefits. Whole grain cereals are rich in dietary fiber, essential vitamins, and minerals, which aid in digestion, support heart health, and help maintain steady energy levels throughout the day. They also contain complex carbohydrates, which are digested slowly, providing sustained energy and preventing blood sugar spikes.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Opting for whole grain cereals over refined options ensures you get more nutrients and fewer added sugars. Pair your cereal with milk or a dairy alternative and some fresh fruit for a balanced, wholesome breakfast.</p>
